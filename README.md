# psytest-pattern-generator
Abstract/inductive reasoning psychometric test generator. Based off abstract/inductive reasoning psychometric tests used in online assessments.
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive tool for generating abstract reasoning tests, specifically focusing on pattern-based questions often seen in psychometric assessments. I created this project to help myself prepare for online assessments used in recruitment as well as general practise for my programming skills.
